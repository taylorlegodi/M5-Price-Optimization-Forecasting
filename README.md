# M5-Price-Optimization-Forecasting
I developed an end-to-end price optimization pipeline using the M5 Walmart dataset. By engineering time-series features and modeling price elasticity with Linear Regression, I identified a strategy to increase revenue by 13.4% on sample items. This project demonstrates my ability to handle 50M+ rows and deliver actionable business value.
